title: Advanced Ray Tracing Part 2
---

In this part of my blog, I continued with the acceleration structures implementation, multisampling and Distirbution Ray Tracing. I also made changes in the overall architecture of my project.  

### Introduction
---
Before starting to implement the new features, I organized the structure of my project which is very helpful for adding new features. So in this part of my blog series, I started to change the structures of the shapes class and its subclasses. I also changed the intersection functions and their return values which is more accurate and compatible for implementation of accelaration structures. These are the overall changes in the architecture of my ray tracer project which I did before adding any more features.

Firstly, as I said above I changed the shapes class and merged with the object class. This class contains one virtual function at the begginnig which is the function for ray object intersection. So I changed the intersection functions as well. Now, they are inherited from the super class named Object. In addition to these, I also changed the elements of the classes Sphere, Triangle and Mesh. I decided that I keep too much information and some of them not used at rendering pipeline. So for more organised and useful architectural design, I decided to decrease the elements that I keep. I also removed the intersection function for Triangle and Mesh and added to Face struct. At the end, my inherited subclasses of object super classes are face and sphere. A I stated, intersection function's return values chaged. Not they are returning a new struct name hit_record which records the properties of the object that I hit. It stores material_id, t value, normal of this object and pointer to this Object(I will come to that in the BVH chapter). with this changes, I generalized the intersection functions for spheres and faces. After I finished the implementation of these classes , I now have a whole new and more convenient subclasses. 

Secondly, since I started to change my overall architecture I decided to changed the generating ray intersection. I defined a class named scene_renderer to keep rendering result, scene struct that I parsed etc. I am defining that so I can keep all of my objects and used them while constructing the BVH tree. I transferred the functions for generating color from ray header to this header since it is more relevant for this header now. I defined a function for putting all the objects to a object vector and I later use that function for constructing BVH tree. I also defined a function for setting the Camera more accurately. I defined that function because later in this project, I will need to use different type of cameras. With this type of notation, I am able to change and adapt easily. After the implementation of this scene class, I am able to finish the architectural changes in my project. So now I can safely and happly start the implementation of these new features.

*Note: Last time, I had a bug in transparency so I leave it as this blogs work. This week after I changed the overall architecture of the project, I noticed the my problem. I was mistaking while constructing the refractiona and reclection rays. I was giving the origin of the ray wrongly. So after I changed that the image is become normal. I will share the new image in the Images section.*


### BVH Structure and Implementation
---

So lets start with the virtual function that I added to the Object super class. I used this function for getting the newly added class members BoundingBox which is a class for the 3D bounding box structure. This box structure includes two elements min_corner and max_corner. As expected from their names, they are representing the corners for bouinding boxes. There are other members for the bounding boxes as delta and center. 'center' is a element for the bounding boxes center and delta is used to find the maxiumdimension for boundingbox which is needed while constructing the BVH tree. These are concluded the changes that I did in my object class.

As I mentioned above, I have a new class named BoundingBox. Also, I had a class named bounding volume hierarchy,too. BoundingBox class and its functions mainly needed while creating the BVH tree. So in this class, the most important funciton is BVH build function. For the tree construction, I also added a class named Node which consists the left and right, leaf elements and a bounding box for the current node of tree. So my bvh tree is constructed with the nodes.

There are several functions for the BoundingBox for finding intersection and expanding the bounding box. For the BVH class, this part includes vector of the objects that it uses while construncting the BVH tree. A Node pointer type element named tree which will be constructed in the this classes contructor. There are also functions for BVH intersection which have two different version for shadow check and returning the intersection record. In addition to these, I used midpoint while building tree which means that I am parting the BoundingBoxes into nodes using the midpoint of the longes axis.

After finishing the BVH implementation, I managed to get power up in my renders. But there seem some minor bugs, because the power up was not as much as I expected.

##### Comments About Project's Benchmark with and without BVH Implementation

Before the implementation of the BVH, I could not even see the result of chinese dragon after several hours of waiting. With the implementation of BVH, it now takes approximately 50 seconds of rendering. Even this much time is not the best result, but taking from several hours of waiting to this point is a very big difference for my project which I think explains why a BVH structure is an essential part of the ray tracing.

For the previous rendering results, the change between the time is not much but acceptable for now. I have a plan on debugging the BVH tree intersection for my rendering to handle what it is the problem. But before that I am going with the multisampling and its effects for new features. I will inspect after these implementations are done.

### Multisampling and Distribution Ray Tracing
---

For the multisampling part, I started with the method I want to procede with. In my sampling method, I am using the square root of the number of samples to divide the pixel. So there will be a boxes whose amount is equal to the number of samples. After that i send each of these boxes a random ray in these divided region. After I send random ray for these divided regions, I am filtering the result and setting the spesified pixels color. 


### Future Tasks
---
There are some left issues about the ply parsing and distribution ray tracing. I also had a bug in my BHV which is slowing down the rendering pipeline of my project. So in order:

* BHV Bug Fix
* ply support
* Left from Distribution Ray Tracing
* Transformation and Instancing
* Motion Blur
* Vertex Offset Support
